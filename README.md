This is just a simple use of the https://socket.io/get-started/chat
tutorial. 

run

node index.js

and visit localhost:3000. It's a web chatroom. You can test it out by
opening two windows.

and if that errors, make sure to run

> npm i

> npm i express

> npm i socket.io

> npm i http

This assumes a working copy of npm and node installed.
